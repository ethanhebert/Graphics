This program renders 4 objects (a pyramid, 2 cubes, and a cylinder) in 3D space with back face culling, polygon filling, 
and Z-buffering, and allows for the translation, in-place uniform scaling, and in-place rotation of each.
The first 3 render modes (1-3) switch between a wireframe, a polygon fill, or both for all objects in the scene.
The next 3 render modes (4-6) switch between flat shading, Gouraud shading, and Phong shading of the cylidner only.
Keys 7-9 are used to control the RGB values of the cylinder to view shading in different colors.

This program generates a still image of 4 spheres on a checkerboard plane using
a recursive ray tracing method which displays reflections, refractions, and objects' local
colors generated by Phong shading along with shadows.

This is a video game created in Unreal Engine 5 by Ethan Hebert, Elijah Payton, and Kesier Dallas. The game features an accurate recreation of Nethken Hall at Louisiana Tech University, a massive and dense jungle, and a serene island beside a cliff. Nethken is packed with details such as recreations of the tiling, doors, and chairs and opening doors. The jungle features dense foliage that blows in the wind, 2 separate temple ruins areas, and surrounding cliffs and hills. The final island area features sunken ships, debris, and two waterfalls with mist. The game displays many skills and tools such as custom assets made in Blender, Niagara FX, UE5 water, a complex landscape material, trigger actors, and character animations.
