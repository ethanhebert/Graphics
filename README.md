This program renders 4 objects (a pyramid, 2 cubes, and a cylinder) in 3D space with back face culling, polygon filling, 
and Z-buffering, and allows for the translation, in-place uniform scaling, and in-place rotation of each.
The first 3 render modes (1-3) switch between a wireframe, a polygon fill, or both for all objects in the scene.
The next 3 render modes (4-6) switch between flat shading, Gouraud shading, and Phong shading of the cylidner only.
Keys 7-9 are used to control the RGB values of the cylinder to view shading in different colors.

This program generates a still image of 4 spheres on a checkerboard plane using
a recursive ray tracing method which displays reflections, refractions, and objects' local
colors generated by Phong shading along with shadows.
